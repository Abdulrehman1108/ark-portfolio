# Contribution and usage

This is an open source project, hence you're welcome to use the code or parts of the code for your own site. When using this project, make tweaks to various components and the theme to really make it your own. Finding it hard to come up with a good color pallete? [Here is a good start!](https://mycolor.space)

If you're not modifying the design much, credit me as the designer of the website.
